## ABSTRACT

<p align="justify">
The study investigates the role of TGF-β1 in Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (XFS) and its progression to Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma (XFG). XFS is a chronic condition characterised by the accumulation of exfoliation material (XFM) in various body tissues, primarily affecting ocular structures. The molecular mechanisms driving XFS/XFG are not clearly understood; increasing evidence suggests that the Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) signalling pathway plays a significant role in the disease’s development.
The main goal is to understand the genes and biological processes, as recent research suggests that TGF-β1 is related to the XFS/XFG.
Using RNA sequencing, the human trabecular meshwork cells’ transcriptome was analysed after stimulation with TGF-β1. Computational tools such as RStudio®, NCBI and Galaxy facilitated the global characterisation of TGF-β1, enabling the identification of differentially expressed genes and potential biological functions related to XFS/XFG. Functional enrichment analysis confirmed that the most highly expressed genes are associated with developmental processes.
Thanks to the differential expression (DE) analysis, it has been determined that the most differentially expressed genes and the main functions in which they are involved are related to the pathology. Confirming that the TGF-β1 pathway is strongly linked to XFS/XFG.
