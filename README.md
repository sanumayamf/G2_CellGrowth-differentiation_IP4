## ABSTRACT

<p align="justify">
  
Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (XFS) is a chronic disorder characterised by the accumulation of extracellular material in various body tissues, primarily ocular tissues, increasing intraocular pressure. Affecting an estimated 60 million people worldwide, XFS can eventually evolve to Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma (XFG), a more severe condition. The molecular mechanisms underlying XFS/XFG are not clearly understood; yet increasing evidence suggests that the Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-β1) signalling pathway plays a significant role in the disease’s development.

This article aims to understand which genes are related to XFG and to identify which biological processes are potentially activated or inhibited in this pathology. To achieve the aim, computational tools such as National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Protein Data Bank (PDB) allowed the global characterisation of TGF-β1. Using RNA sequencing, the human trabecular meshwork cells’ transcriptome was analysed after stimulation with TGF-β1 using RStudio® and Galaxy European Server. Enabling the identification of differentially expressed genes and biological functions related to XFS/XFG. 

Thanks to the differential expression (DE) and functional enrichment analysis, ITGB6 seems to be related to XFG pathology. A deeper understanding of ITGB6’s functions and mechanisms may enable its use as a biomarker or therapeutic target for managing the pathological ECM changes associated in XFG.
