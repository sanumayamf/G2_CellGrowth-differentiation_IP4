## ABSTRACT

<p align="justify">

Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome (XFS) is a chronic disorder characterised by the accumulation of extracellular material in various body tissues, primarily ocular tissues increasing intraocular pressure. Affecting an estimated 60 million people worldwide, XFS can eventually evolve to Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma (XFG), a more severe condition. The molecular mechanisms underlying XFS/XFG are not clearly understood; yet increasing evidence suggests that the Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) signalling pathway plays a significant role in the disease’s development.
This article aims to understand which genes are related to the XFG and to identify which biological processes and genes are potentially activated or inhibited in this pathology. 
Using RNA sequencing, the human trabecular meshwork cells’ transcriptome was analysed after stimulation with TGF-β1. Computational tools such as RStudio®, NCBI and Galaxy European Server facilitated the global characterisation of TGF-β1, enabling the identification of differentially expressed genes and potential biological functions related to XFS/XFG. 
Thanks to the differential expression (DE) analysis and the functional enrichment analysis, it has been determined that the most differentially expressed genes and the main functions in which they are involved, such as developmental processes, are related to the pathology.
