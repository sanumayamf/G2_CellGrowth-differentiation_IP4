INTEGRATED PROJECT IV - Group B2 - UVic-UCC

  * TOPIC: Cell Growth and differentiation
  * MAIN GOAL: identify and characterise the sequences from the raw data
      * Including: localisation, size, determining the optimal experimental model for in-depth study, interactions, variation associated with disease,...
  * ADDITIONAL GOALS: investigate the impact on the transcriptome by analysing RNA sequencing data on the disease, determine the characteristics of the genes and their pathways, usage of bioinformatics and omics analysis and online data bases (Galaxy, NCBI, R-Studio, SRA, UniProt, PDB, MAFFT...)
  * GENE: TGFBR1
  * DISEASE: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS)
