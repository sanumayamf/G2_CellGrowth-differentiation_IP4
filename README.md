INTEGRATED PROJECT IV - Group B2 - UVic-UCC

  * TOPIC: Cell Growth and differentiation
  * MAIN GOAL: identify and characterise the sequences from the raw data
      * It includes localisation, size, determining the optimal experimental model for in-depth study, interactions, variation associated with disease,...
  * ADDITIONAL GOALS: investigate the impact on the transcriptome by analysing RNA sequencing data on the disease, determine the characteristics of the genes and their pathways
  * GENE: TGFBR1
  * DISEASE: Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS)
